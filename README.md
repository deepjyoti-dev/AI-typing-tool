# AI-typing-tool
Your AITypingTool app is nicely structured and functional.

✅ What Works Well
Tkinter UI Design: Clean and simple layout.

Text Comparison: SequenceMatcher gives a useful similarity ratio.

Word-Level Error Detection: Compares each word and returns mismatches.

Feedback Output: Well-formatted result with error samples.

✅ Run Output Example
If the user types:

“NIELIT is also successfully executing Agriculture Census and Input Survey...”

Output might be:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Typing Accuracy: 92.35%
Total Errors: 2

Sample Errors:
Word 7: Expected 'the', Got 'Agriculture'
Word 8: Expected 'Agriculture', Got 'Census'

Highlight Errors in Input Box

Add error highlighting using tag_add and tag_configure.

Visual aid helps understand mistakes faster.

Detailed Error Types

Indicate insertions, deletions, or replacements separately using difflib.ndiff().

Punctuation Sensitivity

Currently split() treats punctuation as part of a word.

Use re.findall(r'\w+|[^\w\s]', text) to separate words and punctuation more cleanly.

Real-Time Feedback (Optional Enhancement)

Use after() to check the input every few seconds for live feedback.
